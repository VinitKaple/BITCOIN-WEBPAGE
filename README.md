# 💻 Frontend Bitcoin Mining Website

This is a **frontend-only** Bitcoin mining website created by me while learning web development. 📄  
It features a **modern and visually appealing design**, offering a smooth user experience for visitors interested in **Bitcoin mining**. 🪙

## 📌 About the Project

- This was my **first project** that I pushed to GitHub.
- I built it while learning **HTML, CSS, and frontend basics**.
- The website is **not functional** for real mining — it's a **design-only** project for learning purposes.
- It includes structured responsive layout and styling.

## 🚧 Note

> This project is **not deployed** and does **not include backend**  
> It was made **just for practice** and to improve my skills in frontend development.
